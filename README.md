temperature_data(linear_regression).ipynb
-Implemented Linear Regression model to estimate the missing values from given temperature dataset
-visualized the data through various types of plots



student_data(supervised and Unsupervised Learning).ipynb
-using the dataset provided, it was preprocessed to change the groups into integer values
-linear regression model was trained and r2 and mse error was calculated
-k means clustering was applied based on study hours and attendance rate and was visualized using a scatter plot.


mnist.ipynb
digit classification was done using mnist dataset by logistic regression model which was then fed into sigmoid activation function ,
SGD algorithm was used for optimization and the model was trained for 20 epochs in sets of 5.
